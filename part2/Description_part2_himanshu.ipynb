    "•\tI figured the types of grants supported by IMLS, which also answered the first question of this part of the project.\n",

    "•\tThen I used histograms to visualize the number of times any specific grant that has been awarded.\n",

    "•\tI used basemap library to plot the latitude and longitude of the areas where grants were awarded during 1996 to 2013\n",

    "•\tI used shape files to get the map of US and then plotted the lat, lon on it.\n",

    "•\tFor example states like NY,MA,PHA and VT have been awarded a lot more grants aa compared to Utah and Iowa.\n",

    "•\tAfter plotting a histogram between the GDP of state and the number of grants awarded to that state I concluded that economic factor does affects the number of grants awarded to any state.\n",
